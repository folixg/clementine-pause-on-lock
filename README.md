# pause-on-lock

Simple script that pauses your music player, when the screen gets locked and
resumes playback once the screen is unlocked again.

## Supported desktop environments

Currently [Unity](https://launchpad.net/unity),
[Cinnamon](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon),
[GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) and [MATE](https://mate-desktop.org/) are
supported. The currently running desktop is detected using
`$XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`.

## Supported players

By default pause-on-lock supports
[Rhythmbox](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Rhythmbox), 
[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/download/linux/) and [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html). If you want support
for more players, you can install
[playerctl](https://github.com/acrisci/playerctl). If playerctl is installed
pause-on-lock supports all players that playerctl can handle.

## Installation

Simply download the executable for the [latest
release](https://github.com/folixg/pause-on-lock/releases/latest) and put it
in a directory of your choosing (e.g. `$HOME/bin`). If you don't want to use
the absolute path to run pause-on-lock, make sure that the folder is in your
`$PATH`. You might need to set the executable bit with `chmod +x
pause-on-lock`.

## Usage

Simply run `pause-on-lock`, there is no further configuration needed.
I strongly recommend to add the pause-on-lock executable to [Startup Applications](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/startup-applications.html),
so it is run every time you log in.

## Compatibility

Should run with all Ubuntu releases >= 16.04
